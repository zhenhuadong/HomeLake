demo spring bean life cycle by xml



issue 1: 
	"spring.lifecycle.bean.name" in application.properties has been changed, but it doesn't take effect.
root cause: 
	"src/main/resources" isn't in your classpath.
solution: 
	open .classpath and add the following line if it is missing
	<classpathentry kind="src" path="src/main/resources" excluding="**/*.java" />
